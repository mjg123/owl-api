Generating the SSL certs

The API is deployed on Azure Functions, so we have to use the manual mode of certbot described here:
https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#manual
We use DNS challenge as it's simpler

Once the certs are generated, we convert them into pfx for azure with:
openssl pkcs12 -export -out cert.pfx -inkey /etc/letsencrypt/live/owls.gilliard.lol/privkey.pem -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/owls.gilliard.lol/cert.pem -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/owls.gilliard.lol/fullchain.pem
then upload the cert.pfx and the password you chose.
